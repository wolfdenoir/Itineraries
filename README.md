# Itineraries
Javascript App for updating People Itineraries in a SharePoint list. Originally created for the use of staff at British Columbia Goverment and Service Employee's Union.

The list structure is as follows:

Staff: People field
Date: Date field
AM: Text field limited to 10 characters
PM: Text field limited to 10 characters

Each record represents a staff's itinerary of a day, with AM representing the Morning schedule and PM representing afternoon schedule. The design is that each input should only have brief information about the staff's whereabouts so it is easy to read at a glance.
